## 6. Pro Tips: Getting the Best AI-Generated Garden Images

### How to Use Your Photos with AI

1. **Start with DALL-E 3 or Adobe Firefly** (easiest):
   - Upload one of your patio photos
   - Tell it: *"Transform this backyard patio area. Replace the cluttered pots with three organized clusters of ceramic planters on pea gravel. Add string lights along the fence top. Mount a wooden trellis with purple clematis on the right side of the fence. Keep the concrete patio and wooden fence."*

2. **For the front yard**, try Midjourney:
   - Prompt: *"Photograph of a south-facing ranch-style home in Boise Idaho, foundation planted with boxwood hedges, purple salvia, orange daylilies, lavender border along front walkway, creeping phlox ground cover, matching ceramic planters flanking front door with red geraniums, American flag on porch-mounted flag pole, golden hour sunlight, residential neighborhood --ar 16:9 --v 6"*

3. **For the side garden bed**, use iScape or DreamzAR:
   - Take a photo of the side bed with your phone
   - Drag in Karl Foerster grass, coneflowers, catmint from the plant library
   - See it in real-time AR overlay

### Sample Prompts for Each Area

#### Back Patio
```
A cozy backyard patio with a wooden privacy fence backdrop. Three curated 
clusters of ceramic planters in green, charcoal, and terra cotta on a bed of 
pea gravel. Tree stumps used as rustic plant stands. Wall-mounted planters 
with trailing pink calibrachoa on the fence. A clematis-covered trellis in one 
corner. Solar string lights draped along the fence top. Warm evening light. 
Boise Idaho style garden. Photorealistic.
```

#### Side Garden Bed
```
A narrow 3-foot wide garden bed along a house wall. Layered planting with 
tall Karl Foerster feather reed grass and pink hollyhocks in back, purple 
catmint and orange coneflowers in the middle, and creeping thyme ground cover 
at the front edge. Fresh bark mulch. Drip irrigation visible. Pacific 
Northwest style. Photorealistic garden photography.
```

#### Front Yard
```
A south-facing ranch home with professional landscaping. Trimmed boxwood 
foundation shrubs, purple salvia and golden black-eyed Susans in the flower 
beds. Lavender lining the front walkway. Creeping phlox cascading over the 
bed edges in spring pink. Large matching emerald green ceramic planters with 
red geraniums flanking the front door. A small climbing rose trellis near 
the entrance. American flag on a wall-mounted pole. Boise Idaho residential 
neighborhood. Warm afternoon light. Photorealistic.
```

### Recommended Workflow

```
Step 1: Identify plants  →  PictureThis / Google Lens (what's already growing?)
Step 2: Plan the layout   →  GrowVeg or Planner Garden (bed layouts & spacing)
Step 3: Visualize it       →  iScape / DreamzAR (AR on your actual photos)
Step 4: Dream renders      →  Midjourney / DALL-E 3 (inspirational images)
Step 5: Track progress     →  Gardenize (photo journal of your transformation)
Step 6: Maintain           →  Planta / Greg (smart watering reminders)
```

*Tip: The best combo for a homeowner is **iScape** (free, drag plants onto your real photos) + **DALL-E 3** (dream-quality inspiration renders) + **Planta** (ongoing care reminders). This covers visualization, inspiration, and maintenance without spending a dime!*
