## 1. Back Covered Patio — Organization & Design

### What I See
- A wooden privacy fence forming the backdrop.
- A **large collection of assorted containers** — ceramic, plastic nursery pots, metal cauldron-style pots, a half whiskey barrel, and rectangular planters — arranged in a somewhat crowded single row along the fence.
- **Tree stumps** used as makeshift plant stands.
- Shepherd's hooks with a red lantern and a bird feeder.
- A tall green ceramic pot on the far left, boxwood hedge behind it.
- Wood-chip mulch scattered on the ground between pots.
- Dead/dormant plant material in most containers (early spring timing).
- A blue watering can tucked among the pots.
- Concrete patio surface in good condition.

### Suggestions

#### A. Declutter & Group by Purpose
| Action | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Remove empty nursery pots** | Black plastic nursery pots (the thin ones) should be stored out of sight or recycled. They detract visually. |
| **Group pots in odd-number clusters** | Arrange in clusters of 3 or 5 at varying heights instead of one long line. This creates visual rhythm. |
| **Create a "thriller, filler, spiller" arrangement** | Each cluster: one tall focal plant (thriller), medium bushy plants (filler), and trailing plants at the edge (spiller). |

#### B. Upgrade Containers
- **Consolidate into fewer, larger, higher-quality pots.** Aim for 6–8 statement containers rather than 15+ mismatched ones.
- Stick to **2–3 complementary materials** — e.g., the green ceramic + weathered whiskey barrels + dark charcoal stoneware.
- The rectangular black planter is great for herbs or a low succulent garden — keep it.

#### C. Use the Tree Stumps Intentionally
- Sand and seal the stumps with an exterior wood sealant to slow decay.
- Use them as **dedicated risers** for your best pots — they add great height variation.
- Alternatively, hollow out the tops slightly and plant **sedums or hens-and-chicks** directly into them.

#### D. Fence as a Design Element
- **Hang planters on the fence** — flat-back wall planters or half-round pots with trailing plants (ivy geraniums, calibrachoa, creeping jenny).
- Add **2–3 more shepherd's hooks** at staggered heights for hanging baskets or solar lanterns.
- Consider a simple **trellis panel** (2–3 ft wide) mounted on the fence for a climbing vine like clematis or a hardy jasmine.

#### E. Add Functional Comfort
- A small **outdoor shelf or potting bench** against the fence would replace the current ad-hoc storage and give you a work surface.
- Add a **doormat or outdoor rug** at the patio edge to define the seating area vs. the garden display area.
- String lights along the fence top or between shepherd's hooks for evening ambiance.

#### F. Ground Layer
- Replace loose wood chips with **pea gravel or decomposed granite** in the strip between the patio edge and fence. This looks cleaner, drains well, and suppresses weeds.
- Edge the gravel with a simple **metal or stone border** to keep it neat.

## 2. Side Garden Beds — Improvements

### What I See
- Narrow garden beds along the side of the house.
- Existing plants appear mostly dormant; some perennials and possibly a few shrubs.
- Bark mulch covering, somewhat thin in places.
- Partial shade (side of house blocks some sun depending on east/west orientation).

### Suggestions

#### A. Soil & Mulch
- **Top up mulch to 2–3 inches** with shredded bark or wood chips to retain moisture and suppress weeds through Boise's dry summer.
- **Amend soil with compost** each spring — Boise's alkaline clay soil benefits greatly from organic matter. Work in 2–3 inches of compost to the top 6 inches.
- Consider adding **sulfur or acidifying fertilizer** if you want to grow acid-loving plants (blueberries, azaleas).

#### B. Layered Planting Design
Since side beds are typically narrow (2–4 ft), use a **front-to-back layering**:

| Layer | Height | Plant Examples |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| **Back (against house)** | 3–5 ft | Tall grasses (Karl Foerster feather reed grass), hollyhocks, delphiniums |
| **Middle** | 1–3 ft | Salvia, catmint (Walker's Low), Russian sage, coneflowers |
| **Front edge** | Under 1 ft | Creeping thyme, sedum, sweet alyssum, dianthus |

#### C. Add Structural Interest
- Plant **1–2 small evergreen shrubs** (dwarf mugo pine, boxwood, or juniper) to anchor the bed year-round.
- Add a **small ornamental boulder or garden art** as a focal point to break up the linear look.
- Consider a simple **drip irrigation line** — side beds along house foundations dry out fast in Boise summers.

#### D. East-Side vs. West-Side Considerations
- **East-facing side bed (morning sun):** Great for plants that appreciate gentler light — hostas (if irrigated), coral bells (Heuchera), astilbe, bleeding heart.
- **West-facing side bed (hot afternoon sun):** Use sun-lovers and heat-tolerant picks — lavender, yarrow, blanket flower, penstemon, daylilies.

## 3. Front Yard — Curb Appeal

### What I See
- South-facing front = **full sun all day** (the hottest, brightest exposure).
- Existing foundation plantings and lawn area.
- Standard residential Boise neighborhood look.

### Suggestions

#### A. Foundation Planting Refresh
- **Evergreen backbone:** Keep or add compact shrubs like boxwood, dwarf Alberta spruce, or blue star juniper near the foundation.
- **Add perennial color in front of shrubs:** Daylilies, black-eyed Susans, and salvia provide months of color with minimal water.
- **Edge beds with low growers:** Creeping phlox (stunning spring bloom), candytuft, or low-growing sedum.

#### B. Xeriscape / Water-Wise Front Yard
Boise's dry climate makes water-wise landscaping both practical and attractive:
- **Swap high-water-use annuals** for drought-tolerant perennials (see Section 4).
- Add **decorative rock or gravel mulch** in sunny areas — it reflects heat away from plant roots less than you'd think and eliminates watering needs in mulched zones.
- A **dry creek bed** with river rock can add visual interest and handle occasional runoff.

#### C. Entryway Impact
- **Flank the front door** with matching large containers planted with seasonal color.
- A **climbing rose or clematis** on a small trellis or obelisk near the entry adds vertical drama.
- Ensure **pathway plantings are fragrant** — lavender, catmint, or dianthus along a walkway delight visitors.

## 5. Seasonal Planting Calendar

### 🌱 Spring (March–May)
- **March:** Start seeds indoors (tomatoes, peppers, zinnias). Plant pansies and violas in containers for early color.
- **April:** Plant bare-root roses, perennials, and cool-season veggies (lettuce, peas, spinach). Divide and transplant existing perennials. Last average frost in Boise: ~May 10.
- **May (after May 10):** Plant annuals, warm-season containers, and tender bulbs (dahlias, gladiolus). Set up drip irrigation.

### ☀️ Summer (June–August)
- **June:** Deadhead spent blooms for rebloom. Mulch beds 2–3 inches. Deep water 1–2x/week rather than shallow daily watering.
- **July:** Cut back catmint and salvia after first flush for a second wave of blooms. Watch for spider mites in hot weather.
- **August:** Start planning fall bulb orders. Take cuttings of geraniums and coleus to overwinter indoors.

### 🍂 Fall (September–November)
- **September:** Plant spring-blooming bulbs (tulips, daffodils, crocus, alliums). Best time to plant trees and shrubs — roots establish before winter.
- **October:** Plant garlic. Clean up containers — store tender pots indoors. Top-dress beds with compost.
- **November:** Apply winter mulch around tender perennials. Wrap young tree trunks to prevent sunscald.

### ❄️ Winter (December–February)
- **December–January:** Plan next year's garden! Order seeds from catalogs. Clean and sharpen tools.
- **February:** Prune dormant trees and shrubs (not spring-bloomers). Start earliest seeds indoors under lights.

## 6. Container Gardening Tips

Since you have a strong container collection, here's how to maximize it:

### Best Practices for Boise Containers
1. **Use large pots (14"+)** — they retain moisture better in Boise's dry heat and insulate roots from temperature swings.
2. **Quality potting mix** — use a commercial container mix (not garden soil). Add perlite for extra drainage.
3. **Self-watering inserts or drip emitters** — containers in full sun may need watering twice daily in July/August.
4. **Fertilize regularly** — liquid feed every 2 weeks or use slow-release granules at planting time.
5. **Protect ceramic pots in winter** — Boise's freeze-thaw cycles crack glazed pots. Store them in a garage or wrap with bubble wrap.

### Container Recipe Ideas

**"Sunny Thriller-Filler-Spiller" (full sun):**
- Thriller: Ornamental grass (Purple Fountain Grass) or Canna Lily
- Filler: Red geraniums + dusty miller
- Spiller: Sweet potato vine (chartreuse) + trailing verbena

**"Shady Elegance" (north/east side):**
- Thriller: Caladium (large leaves)
- Filler: Begonias + coleus
- Spiller: Creeping Jenny (golden)

**"Herb Container Garden" (back patio, full sun):**
- Center: Rosemary (upright)
- Middle: Basil, thyme, oregano
- Edge: Trailing nasturtiums (edible flowers!)

**"Whiskey Barrel Pollinator Garden":**
- Lavender (center)
- Catmint + salvia (mid)
- Creeping thyme (edge)
